        <h3>NOVEMBER 10 2019 - On HK</h3>
      </div>

      <p>
      Great Britain took Hong Kong from China in the opium wars, where gb was trying to extract wealth and gain control 
        in China by introducing opium and then using force. At the end of the war gb was given Hong Kong. After this 
        British control increased in china and opium use doubled. Then the us, French and Great Britain fought a second 
        opium war 15 years later because the colonial powers needed more influence in the area, and gb got even more land.
        The HK deal was later renegotiated to be a 99 year lease in 1898. This period (after the first opium war) is 
        referred to as the century of shame in China, and gb continued to exert its economic power over China. Under 
        British rule, law was very oppressive to the people of HK, including sex slavery, curfews, and the blocking of 
        Chinese from living in the best areas. We will skip over the revolution in China, but note that this allowed China
        to break out of feudalism, industrialize, and grow massively, leaving the century of shame. However after the lease
        was up in the 1990s, Hong Kong was not just given back. GB insisted on Hong Kong to have independence, so China
        complied and allowed “two economic systems, one country” to exist for another 80 years after which Honk Kong would
        be fully integrated with China. China exerted little control at all on HK, and over the last 20 years HK has become
        one of the areas with the most economic inequality in the world, with a huge housing crisis and 20% poverty rate. Well
        why are people protesting now? After a Taiwanese guy murdered his wife and fled to HK, extradition treaties needed to
        be made to extradite this guy to Taiwan. So China created an extradition treaty between themselves, HK (part of China
        formally) and Taiwan, and this was twisted into “loosing democracy” (funded by at least cia group national endowment
        for democracy, can literally see on website) due to the fact that the capitalists are scared to be extradited to China
        for their crimes, where the rich and politicians are actually held accountable for crimes unlike in capitalist nations.
        Additionally, poverty in China is almost 0, so the vast majority of the HK citizens would be much better off under that
        economic system. Additionally China is not near as authoritarian as it is made out to be, social credit is used to 
        encourage good faith action by the government (there is no score), working conditions are better than in the us in many 
        cases, and uyhugr camps/organ harvesting are complete fabrications. Hong Kong relies heavily on the economy of China now, 
        giving 55% of trade and 80% of tourism in HK. As of 2017 poll 60% of people support becoming China, vs 11.4% for 
        independence. So you can see from China’s perspective the protests are completely fucking ludicrous.
